# Questions
1. If all the tasks have the same run time of 1, then the only thing determining waiting times would be the order in which the jobs arrived. This is when SRTN and FIFO would have the same Turn around times <br>
2. If the time to finish a task is less than the time quantum when the response time for both RR and SRTN would be the same <br>
3. The Turnaround gets greater and greater. Yes this can be tested on the simulator <br>
4. Response time would increase since once a process is blocked, it takes more time to return to it.
